# IPL Power Play Predictor using XGBoost

This project is an IPL (Indian Premier League) power play predictor implemented in Python using the XGBoost model. The goal is to predict the total runs scored by a team during the power play overs (first 6 overs) of an IPL match. The model is trained on historical IPL data and can provide insights into the expected performance of a team during the power play.

## Introduction

The IPL Power Play Predictor is a machine learning project that leverages the power of XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting algorithm, to predict the total runs scored by a team in the power play overs. By analyzing various features such as team performance, venue, and player statistics, the model can provide an estimate of the team's performance during the initial phase of an IPL match.

This project serves as a useful tool for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and team strategists to gain insights and make informed decisions based on predicted power play scores.

## Installation

To use the IPL Power Play Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/VastavTailwal/dataworks.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd dataworks

3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the model using the provided dataset (see [Model Training](#model-training)).

## Usage

To predict the power play score for an IPL match, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary input data, such as team performance, venue details, and player statistics.

2. Modify the configuration variables in the `mymodelfile.py` file to suit your requirements, such as input data format and model path.

3. Run the following command: python main.py

The script will train the trained XGBoost model, process the input data, and provide the predicted power play score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the IPL Power Play Predictor consists of historical IPL match data, including team performance, venue details, and player statistics during the power play overs. The dataset is not provided in this repository, but you can use your own dataset or explore publicly available IPL datasets.

Ensure that your dataset contains relevant features and target values for training the power play prediction model.

## Model Training

To train the IPL Power Play Predictor model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset with relevant features and target values (power play scores).

2. Modify the configuration variables in the `mymodelfile.py` file to suit your dataset and training requirements.

3. Run the training script: python main.py
